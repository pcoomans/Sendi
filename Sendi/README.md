# Sendi
 Library to create a loosely coupled communication structure within an application
 
 With Sendi you can organise communication within an application, in loosely coupled, multi-threaded, expandable way.
 
 Any communication client, which can send and receive messages, can be connected to the central message dispatcher. 
 Typically the message dispatcher is active as long as the application is running. Clients can connect and disconnect at all times.
